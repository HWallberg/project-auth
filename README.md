# Project Auth API

Pair-programming peoject by Isabell Wastfelt and Hanna Wallberg.

This project's goal was developing an API with authentication in order to implement a sign-in/sign-up interface with authentication.

## The problem

We learned how to authenticate users using tokens and how to store passwords in databases in a secure way. We also created a Frontend with a form to register, sign in and be able to see restricted content in case the login was successful.

We used MongodB and Mongoose to build our Backend Express API.
